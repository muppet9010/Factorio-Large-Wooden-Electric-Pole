# Factorio-Large-Wooden-Electric-Pole

Adds a long wire reach wooden electric pole to connect power across larger distances early game. Intended for equivilent use as the Big Electric Pole in mid and late game.

The Large Wooden Electric Pole costs double the regular Small Electric Pole, making it slightly more cost effecient over longer distances. It has no supply radius.
The games vanilla Small Electric Pole is changed to use an icon image that matches the ingame building (flat topped wooden pole).
The new Large Wooden Electric Pole uses an old version of the games wooden pole graphics for its building and icon.
